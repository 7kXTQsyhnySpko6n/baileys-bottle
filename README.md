# Baileys bottle

## A little package made by deadlinecode for storing all the data from baileys in whatever database you want to use by using typeorm

`Please note that this package is to be seen as a work-in-progress thing and therefore contains a lot of bugs... i mean features xD`<br/>
`In a nutshell: Be aware that this isn't stable and neither tested in any way`

This package creates a store for a baileys bot instance. You can pass in a database connection to the functions and they will use that connection to create all the needed tables and save all the data to the database using typeorm, which supports all different kinds of databases.

TypeORM currently supports:

- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Postgres
- CockroachDB
- SQLite
- Microsoft¬†SQL¬†Server
- Oracle
- SAP¬†Hana
- sql.js

## Installation

```bash
npm install baileys-bottle
```

## Usage

Take a look at the information in the [example folder](https://github.com/deadlinecode/baileys-bottle/blob/master/src/example/)

## I wanna tweak it for my own use case

Sure thing! You can tinker with the package like this:

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deadlinecode/baileys-bottle .
   ```
2. Change stuff you wanna change
3. Build the package
   ```bash
   npm build
   ```
4. Install it in another nodejs project from wherever you saved it on your disk
   ```bash
   # inside your other project
   npm install /path/to/the/repo/named/baileys-bottle
   ```
   or alternatively run the example
   ```bash
   # inside the package folder

   ```

If you found an issue or would like to submit an improvement, please open an issue using the issues tab in github.

If you actually have some spare time and want to contribute, feel free to open a PR and please don't forget to (create and) link the corresponding issue. <br/>
It's important so we can keep track of all the issues and feature requests that got resolved by PRs.

## Known issues/feature requests (WIP)

- [ ] Get rid of all the DBId's so we have an actual primary key for every table (or also don't if we implementing the multi instance stuff we will prbbly need this xD)

- [ ] Support multiple instance (currently only one instance is supported | mby by linking the corresponding stuff inside the auth table)

- [ ] Add the ability to change the behavior of data changes (e.g. if you want to keep deleted messages in the database)

- [ ] Add fetch functions to refresh data (also mby execute them on startup)

- [ ] Improve the linking between tables (e.g. MessageDic.ts)
